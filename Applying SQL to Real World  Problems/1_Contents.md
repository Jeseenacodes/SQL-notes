# SQL Training Portfolio

### **Overview**

This portfolio documents my completion of an end-to-end SQL training program focused on real-world data analysis, database management, and clean coding practices. Through practical projects and structured learning, I developed the ability to **query, transform, manage, and optimize data** in relational databases using industry-standard SQL.

## **Chapter 1: Use Real-World SQL**

**Focus:** Foundational SQL commands and transformations for real-world analysis.

**Key Skills & Concepts**

* Writing **SELECT**, **WHERE**, **ORDER BY**, and **GROUP BY** queries.
* Applying **string transformations** (`UPPER`, `LOWER`) for data formatting.
* Performing **numeric calculations** using arithmetic operators.
* Extracting **date/time components** with the `EXTRACT()` function.
* Using **column aliases** to improve readability and clarity.

**Outcome:**
Gained the ability to write analytical queries that extract, clean, and transform data for business insights.

## **Chapter 2: Find Your Data**

**Focus:** Exploring database structures and performing joins across multiple tables.

**Key Skills & Concepts**

* Using the **`information_schema.columns`** system table to explore tables and columns.
* Aggregating metadata with **`STRING_AGG()`** to create easy reference tables.
* Creating **views** for reusable data exploration tools.
* Building **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** to visualize table connections.
* Applying **JOINs** and **subqueries** to combine data from multiple sources.

**Outcome:**
Developed the ability to navigate and understand relational databases efficiently and to design joins and ERDs for complex analytical questions.

## **Chapter 3: Manage Your Data**

**Focus:** Creating, updating, and maintaining database tables and records.

**Key Skills & Concepts**

* **Creating new tables** using both new and existing data (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`).
* **Creating views** to store queries for dynamic analysis.
* Understanding the difference between **TABLE** (stores data snapshot) and **VIEW** (stores query logic).
* Using **UPDATE** statements with and without **subqueries** to modify records safely.
* Deleting data responsibly with **DELETE**, **TRUNCATE**, and **DROP** commands.
* Following best practices before altering data—testing conditions and checking downstream impact.

**Outcome:**
Gained confidence in managing data lifecycles — from creation and modification to safe deletion — while maintaining database integrity.

## **Chapter 4: Best Practices for Writing SQL**

**Focus:** Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient SQL scripts.

**Key Skills & Concepts**

* **Conveying intent** using `AS` for aliases and explicit `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
* Writing **readable code** using:

  * Capitalized SQL keywords
  * Indentation & new lines for clarity
  * `snake_case` naming conventions
  * `IN` and `BETWEEN` for concise filtering
* **Using comments effectively** to explain logic — not to clutter code.
* Avoiding common mistakes such as:

  * Over-commenting or redundant notes
  * Using `SELECT *` unnecessarily
  * Treating SQL like a programming language

**Outcome:**
Learned how to write SQL scripts that are **clear, professional, and easy to maintain**, ensuring smooth collaboration and long-term usability.

## **Final Recap & Reflection**

**Program Summary**
* **Chapter 1:** Query and transform data.
* **Chapter 2:** Explore and join tables using ERDs.
* **Chapter 3:** Create, update, and delete data responsibly.
* **Chapter 4:** Apply best practices for readable, maintainable SQL.

**Personal Takeaway**
This training strengthened my SQL foundation and sharpened my ability to think analytically about data. I now write SQL scripts that are not only functional but also efficient, structured, and production-ready — key skills for any data analyst or data scientist.

## **Technical Stack**
* SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL syntax compatible)
* ER Diagrams
* Data Modeling
* Database Design & Management

## **Next Steps**

* Apply SQL skills to analytics projects (e.g., sales, healthcare, or customer churn).
* Integrate SQL workflows with Python and Power BI for end-to-end data analysis.
* Continue refining query optimization and database automation techniques.
